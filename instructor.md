**Gary Brierley **is a river scientist who specializes in the use of science in management applications (especially river rehabilitation and conservation). There has been extensive uptake of a research tool that he co-developed (the River Styles framework ([www.riverstyles.com](http://www.riverstyles.com/)). Professor Brierley's research extends across both scientific and management fields. His primary interest presently lies in the development and application of coherent scientific guidance with which to promote an era of river repair in a manner that respects the inherent diversity and variability of river systems. Key themes for Professor Brierley's research output include: sedimentology, human impacts on river systems, sediment budgets, river management, environmental governance and education. His research has been published in various outlets, including several books, over 70 internationally refereed journal articles, over 20 refereed conference proceedings, over 20 sections in books, various review articles/comments, and over 55 commissioned and/or consultancy reports.

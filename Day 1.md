### Day 1

Our aim on Day 1 is to bring everyone in the workshop up to speed on stage 1 of the River Styles Framework, focusing on how to describe and assess river character and behaivor. We will spend the morning lecturing on the topics below (click on each for more info) and the afternoon working in the computer lab on applying River Styles in the Logan River Watershed. The field exercise will take us on a journey down the Logan River from near its headwaters down to its mouth at Cutler Reservoir. We will make multiple stops and contrast the character and behavior of different River Styles that we analyzed in the morning.

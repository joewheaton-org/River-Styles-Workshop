### F. Field Trip - River Styles on the Ground



#### Overview

At each site, we will expand/verify the proforma filled out in the [lab exercise]({{ site.baseurl }}/Topics/Day1/e), with particular emphasis on geomorphic unit assemblage, sediment patterns, and riparian vegetation associations. For the group that was responsible for this site [proforma in the lab](http://etal.usu.edu/Workshops/RiverStyles/2013/Excercises/Day1/ProFormas.pdf), they will provide a 5 minute (max.) summary presentation to the group. All groups will be responsible for filling out the proformas at each site.

The presentation will include a summary of the distinguishing character attributes of that River Style. Just as importantly, the presentation will provide an overview of the behavior regime of that river (i.e. the processes that create and rework each of the geomorphic units found on the valley floor).

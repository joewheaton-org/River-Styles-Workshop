### B. Approaches to Analysis of River Character and Behaviour

### Background

#### Synopsis of Topic

The River Styles framework is a geomorphic approach for examining river character, behaviour, condition and recovery potential. This provides a physical template for river management.  This lecture focuses on an overview of step 2 in Stage 1 of the framework: "Definition and Interpretation of River Styles".

#### Why We're Covering It

Much of Day 1's focus is on understanding the physical character and behavior of rivers - a key underpinning of Stage 1 of the River Styles Framework. Without an appreciation of how to analyze river character and behavior, sensible classification of the drainage network into River Styles cannot be performed or effectively interpreted. 

#### Learning Outcomes

This topics helps us with the following learning outcome for the workshop:

- Through lectures, laboratory exercises, field visits and discussions, develop a working knowledge of Stage 1 of the River Styles framework (river character and behaviour, analysis of catchment-scale river patterns)

### J. River Condition Assessment & Recovery Potential



### Background

#### Synopsis of Topic

Stages 2 & 3 of the River Styles framework will be covered in this lecture and the basis for afternoon activities.



#### Why We're Covering It

Being able to assess river condition and recovery potential are keys to developing realistic management and/or restoration options.

 

#### Learning Outcomes

This topics helps us with the following learning outcomes for the workshop:

- Through lectures, laboratory exercises, field visits and discussions, develop a working knowledge of Stage 1 of the River Styles framework (river character and behaviour, analysis of catchment-scale river patterns) 
- Show how measures of river condition vary for different types of river (i.e. what measures are important; what we measure against; emphasis upon asking the right questions … use of qualitative understandings alongside quantitative measures)

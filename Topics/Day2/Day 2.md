### Day 2



In the morning, we will complete our Stage 1 exercise from yesterday by building River Styles procedural trees, identifying the controls and assigning boundaries to these reach types. 

In the afternoon we will move into learning approaches to analysis of geomorphic river condition and recovery potential (Stages 2 and 3 of the River Styles framework).

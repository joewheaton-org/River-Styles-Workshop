### L. Framing Visions & Target Conditions



### Background

#### Synopsis of Topic

Moving past and integrating the  condition assessment (Stage 2) and recovery potential (Stage 3) and developing  visions and target conditions for your watershed is the crux of the River Styles framework and the focus of the final stage (Stage 4). 



#### Learning Outcomes

This topics helps us with the following learning outcomes for the workshop:

- Outline limitations of current river restoration practices and what we could do (ought to be doing) differently

- Show how measures of river condition vary for different types of river (i.e. what measures are important; what we measure against; emphasis upon asking the right questions … use of qualitative understandings alongside quantitative measures)

-  Scope future options for river management planning and on-the-ground activities - Use assessments of river character and behaviour, their patterns, and appraisals of river condition and recovery potential to develop catchment framed visions that assess what is realistically achievable through management interventions (i.e. thoughts towards a geomorphically-informed catchment management plan, linking conservation and rehabilitation goals), targeted management activities that work towards this vision, a rationale for a prioritization of activities (where to start and why), and how/where to apply monitoring programmes

# Web Anabranch

This is just a quick test of the Gitbook Engine

This site uses [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to render markdown and Github Pages to host it.  

## Where to find things:

* `_includes/navigation.md` - Navigation on this site is manually created in this file
* `_includes/links.md` - Extra links that appear underneath the navigation
* `css/*.scss` - The CSS styling for your site.

### I see special HTML I don't recognize

This site uses the [foundation framework](http://foundation.zurb.com). Checkout [their docs](http://foundation.zurb.com/sites/docs/) for specific instructions about special HTML tags and classes.
